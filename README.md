 # Machine Learning Engineer Nanodegree Capstone Project

## Predicting Bitcoin Price with LSTM neural network

This proeject aims to build a bitcoin trading strategy based on the predictions from LSTM RNN.
The data set is obtained from https://coinmarketcap.com  and stored in bitcoin_data.csv
The model ius buit with Keras anfd Tensorflow backend
The code is located in the jutyter notebook in the ml_engineer_capstone.ipynb
